## About The Project

COVID 19 is a virus that has entered our lives in recent years and spreads rapidly and affects the upper respiratory tract, which has become a pandemic. With the increase in data accumulation in recent years with COVID19, machine learning studies create both a current trend and a new field of study. Within the scope of this study, using the COVID19 pre-condition data set on the Kaggle data science platform; The raw data was passed through the data preprocessing steps and the hospitalization intensive care unit status of the patients who came to the hospital was tried to be estimated with machine learning models. Three different machine learning models were used during this estimation, these are; GBM are XGBOOST and LightGBM. After these three models were modelled, they were subjected to the Super Learner process and approximately 99% success was achieved by using LightGBM as meta classifier, GBM and XGBOOST as basic classifier. In addition, the same operations were repeated with the data set that did not pass the pre-processing stage, and the importance of data pre-processing was demonstrated by achieving approximately 88% success.
